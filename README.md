# Implement Convolutional neural networks (CNN) in FPGA

This implemetation is my Bachelor degree final Project!
There are some ways and tools to implement a neural network on FPGA, but in this project i design a simple Convolutional neural network on FPGA with VHDL design without Implementation tools. 
so, you can also download my final Report for this Project in ./report folder (in persian)


## Parts of this project:
 - Train a Convolutional neural networks in **Pytorch**
 - Extract all parameters by using **ONNX**
 - Make all parameters **Fixed-Point**
 - Design all part of a CNN model: Convolution, Activation Function, Max-Pooling, Classification part
 - Test all module
